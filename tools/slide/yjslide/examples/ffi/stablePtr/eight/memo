Note that no assumptions may be made about the values
representing stable pointers. In fact, they need not even be valid
memory addresses. The only guarantee provided is that if they
are passed back to Haskell land, the function deRefStablePtr
will be able to reconstruct the Haskell value referred to by the
stable pointer
