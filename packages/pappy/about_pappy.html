<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>
Packrat parsing is a novel and practical method
for implementing linear-time parsers
for grammars defined in Top-Down Parsing Language (TDPL).
While TDPL was originally created as a formal model
for top-down parsers with backtracking capability,
this thesis extends TDPL
into a powerful general-purpose notation for describing language syntax,
providing a compelling alternative
to traditional context-free grammars (CFGs).
Common syntactic idioms
that cannot be represented concisely in a CFG
are easily expressed in TDPL,
such as longest-match disambiguation and "syntactic predicates,"
making it possible
to describe the complete lexical and grammatical syntax
of a practical programming language
in a single TDPL grammar.

</p><p>
Packrat parsing is an adaptation of a 30-year-old tabular parsing algorithm
that was never put into practice until now.
A packrat parser can recognize
any string defined by a TDPL grammar in linear time,
providing the power and flexibility
of a backtracking recursive descent parser
without the attendant risk of exponential parse time.
A packrat parser can recognize any LL(<i>k</i>) or LR(<i>k</i>) language,
as well as many languages requiring unlimited lookahead
that cannot be parsed by shift/reduce parsers.
Packrat parsing also provides better composition properties than LL/LR parsing,
making it more suitable for dynamic or extensible languages.
The primary disadvantage of packrat parsing is its storage cost,
which is a constant multiple of the total input size
rather than being proportional to the nesting depth
of the syntactic constructs appearing in the input.

</p><p>
Monadic combinators and lazy evaluation
enable elegant and direct implementations of packrat parsers
in recent functional programming languages such as Haskell.
Three different packrat parsers for the Java language
are presented here,
demonstrating the construction of packrat parsers in Haskell
using primitive pattern matching, using monadic combinators,
and by automatic generation from a declarative parser specification.
The prototype packrat parser generator developed for the third case
itself uses a packrat parser to read its parser specifications,
and supports full TDPL notation
extended with "semantic predicates,"
allowing parsing decisions to depend on the semantic values
of other syntactic entities.
Experimental results show that all of these packrat parsers
run reliably in linear time,
efficiently support "scannerless" parsing
with integrated lexical analysis,
and provide the user-friendly error-handling facilities
necessary in practical applications.

<h3>Example Java Language Parsers</h3>

The three complete and working parsers for the Java language,
which are described in the paper and used
for analysis and comparison purposes,
are available here:

<ul>
<li>	<b><a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/%7Ebaford/packrat/thesis/java/JavaMonad.hs">JavaMonad.hs</a></b>:
	A packrat parser for the Java language
	that exclusively uses monadic combinators
	to define the parsing functions making up the parser.
	Both "safe", constant-time combinators
	and "unsafe" combinators with hidden recursion
	are used in this parser,
	meaning that it is not quite a linear-time parser
	although it appears to come pretty close in practice.

</li><li>	<b><a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/%7Ebaford/packrat/thesis/java/JavaPat.hs">JavaPat.hs</a></b>:
	A version of the above parser
	modified to use direct Haskell pattern-matching
	for some of the performance-critical lexical analysis functions:
	whitespace, identifiers, keywords, operators,
	and integer, character, and string literals.
	The rest of the parser is monadic just as before,
	and likewise uses "unsafe" combinators.

</li><li>	<b><a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/%7Ebaford/packrat/thesis/java/Java.pappy">Java.pappy</a></b>:
	Pappy parser specification for the Java language.
	The resulting automatically-generated parser
	is available as <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/%7Ebaford/packrat/thesis/java/Java.hs">Java.hs</a>.
	Since Pappy rewrites repetition operators,
	this parser uses only constant-time primitives
	and therefore should be a strictly linear-time parser -
	at least to the extent that memory access is constant-time
	(which is not quite the case
	in the presence of garbage collection and cache effects and such).
</li></ul>
